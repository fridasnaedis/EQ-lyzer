# EQ-lyzer

### The problem EQ-lyzer solves

Some people don’t think about how the messages they write to their co-workers come across. Other people really read into messages and get hurt by blunt comments and therefore don’t feel their work is appreciated. The clashing that happens because of this is unneccessary and can be eliminated by rephrasing comments and/or converting them into real constructive criticism.



## What it does

The product is a chrome extension called EQ-lyzer. When prompted, the extensions analyzes text that the user has written and, with the help of Azure’s Text Analytics AI, the sentence is given a grade in the form of a sentence and an emoji. The grade encourages the user to phrase the sentence more friendly with the person receiving it in mind.


We chose the name EQ-lyzer because it’s a mash of EQ and Analyze. Emotional Quotient (EQ) is the capacity to be aware of, control and express one’s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. 
EQ is often not regarded highly in the Tech Industry even though it should be. 

## How we built it

We used Javascript, HTML, CSS for the extension and Azure’s Text Analytics AI for the text analysis.
